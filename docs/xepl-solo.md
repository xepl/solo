# XEPL SOLO Environment

XEPL uses the names used in biology and neuroscience to describe computer science as a software Operating Environment that emulates the Cortex of the Brain.

![Powerful New Environment](https://www.xepl.net/images/solo/DALL·E%202024-03-30%2018.00.56.jpg)

XEPL OE is the "core" Operating Environment.

XEPL Solo is a cheap and easy Html/Javascript User Interface.

XEPL OE + SOLO is a Cortex + User Interface Demonstration of XEPL.

![Individual Development Environment](https://www.xepl.net/images/solo/DALL·E%202024-04-23%2009.11.16.jpg)

Together, XEPL OE + SOLO provides a dynamic Web Server implementation for viewing the contents of a running Cortex.

XEPL OE doesn't require or use the browser; but the Solo Demonstration does.  

## Ultimate Learning Tool

Together, Solo demonstrates XEPL ... while ... XEPL Powers Solo.

![Self-Contained, Ultra Approachable](https://www.xepl.net/images/solo/DALL·E%202024-04-23%2009.18.52.jpg)

XEPL Solo is a full-blown learning experience for those that are just beginning.  There are a lot of moving parts, so take it slow.  In the end, you'll have more compute/programming knowledge and a personal set of tools.

![Beautiful Software Designs](https://www.xepl.net/images/solo/DALL·E%202024-04-23%2009.13.38.jpg)

## Demonstration Framework

XEPL OE + Solo is just a demonstration.  There is not a lot of code here; there is nothing "science like" difficult and all you need is a freely available C++ Compiler and a basic web Browser to get started.

![A Perfect System](https://www.xepl.net/images/aiarteest/DALL·E%202024-03-06%2014.02.41.jpg)

Young people ... here is your calling !

*Even a Raspberry Pi can build and launch XEPL Solo in under a minute.*

Imagine the fun things you can make !

![Your system, Your world](https://www.xepl.net/images/games/DALL·E%202024-03-10%2011.54.11.jpg)

## Tradition Update 2.0

Today's "traditional" software, grew-up to require many tools ... some to understand the build, one to compile the sources, another to link their binaries. Then, there are resources, config files, manifests, images, scripts ... it can get really complicated.

![Born small; packed and overly complex](https://www.xepl.net/images/yesterday/DALL·E%202024-04-22%2009.04.34.jpg)

Things can be much, much simpler.

![Coding is fun ... again](https://www.xepl.net/images/concept/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2012.39.46.jpg)

Simple connections, simple done.

![Auto disconnect](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-04-23%2008.48.06.jpg)

Power up your knowledge of the future ... today.

![The next evolution](https://www.xepl.net/images/concept/DALL·E%202024-04-22%2009.32.44.jpg)

Grow up together.  Get Smarter, have a career, grow forward.

![Together we Grow](https://www.xepl.net/images/growth/DALL·E%202024-02-06%2011.06.36.jpg)

# Hardware Explosion

Hardware is a diverse bunch of ever evolving and always shrinking components.  Hardware improved according to Moore's law, basically doubling in capability every 18 months.

![Geometric growth in capabilities](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex_machines/DALL·E%202024-03-06%2014.07.12.jpg)

Hardware needs an Operating System ... not software.

![Hardware needs an Operating System to be controlled.](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex_machines/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2003.23.24.jpg)

# Behavioral Programming

Software needs an Operating Environment.

Behavioral Algorithms are different.  

Describing behaviors that respond to Signals by generating new Signals.

![Signals can be anything and everything](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2009.19.50.jpg)

In XEPL, you model execution inside Neurons, and Data is in motion in a Common World View of memories, where everything is connected and available concurrently to all other Neurons.

![XEPL is for Multi-Threading](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex_machines/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2009.38.31.jpg)

In Software, We don't really care ... what must happen below.  Just that it does, and reliably so.

With Multi-threading on multi-core the thread-safe Common World View, XEPL is your software panacea.

![Software, just needs a comfortable Environment in which to work.](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex_machines/DALL·E%202024-02-26%2014.38.58.jpg)

Turns out, being able to update running software is more important than building it.

![And, Developers need precision control.](https://www.xepl.net/images/robots/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2009.48.03.jpg)

## Fresh Start

You still have everything that you already have in C++ programming. 

With XEPL you also have a whole new environment and technique available to solve soft problems.

![Over their Smart Applications they'll soon create](https://www.xepl.net/images/baby/DALL·E%202024-02-06%2010.34.30.jpg)

# XEPL is Yours

Everything is included.

![XEPL includes Neurons and DNA](https://www.xepl.net/images/concept/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2012.37.30.jpg)

## Speed of Thought
Coding at the speed of thought.

![Imagine the possibilities.](https://www.xepl.net/images/idea/DALL·E%202024-02-22%2007.26.45.jpg)

## Simple complex systems
You can build complex systems and be running and run in seconds.

![Instant Turnaround](https://www.xepl.net/images/ai_thoughts/DALL·E%202024-02-13%2014.30.37.jpg)


# Why XEPL works

XEPL is a software operating environment to share data with connected Neurons.

![Everything is connected](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex_machines/DALL·E%202024-02-22%2007.00.51.jpg)


## Packaged Neurons
Package up Neurons with Neurons, and connect Genes to Genes.

![Packaged Neurons and DNA](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-02-22%2007.15.01.jpg)

## Sending Signals
Send DNA... as a Signal.

Neurons Signal Neurons to carry the Genes.

![Neuron Signals Neuron](https://www.xepl.net/images/neurons/DALL·E%202024-03-24%2014.13.24.jpg)

## Signal Travel

Recursion is used throughout.  There are only a few moving parts in XEPL, and recursion builds mountains out of sand.

![Signals recurse seemingly indefinitely](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-04-21%2010.46.07.jpg)

And can be processed ... anywhere.

![Dynamic Neuron Networks](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna_cortex/DALL·E%202024-02-06%2011.47.57.jpg)

## XEPL is Strings

The XEPL OE uses dynamic "strings for everything", provides invisible locks for everything.  

![Strings of Strings of Strings](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-04-23%2009.08.40.jpg)

## No data types
There are no data types in XEPL, even Numbers are strings ;) 

and so are the odd ones !

![Everything is DNA](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-05-02%2012.34.25.jpg)

## Perfect Integration

Data perfectly integrated with processing.

![Connect everything to everything.](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna_cortex/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2011.10.10.jpg)


## The XEPL Data Fabric

Data storage is in a lattice of trees of XML like data.

Connect Genes to Neurons, Genes connect to Genes, and Signal Genes in a Common World View.

![The new fabric of space](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-04-21%2010.45.18.jpg)

XEPL DNA Genes are the ultimate, reprogrammable, storage system.

Data is DNA and DNA is code.

![Everything is DNA](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2009.18.45.jpg)

## XEPL Computing

Neurons are Nano-like computers that connect together using DNA to become fully distributed cortexes.

![Everything is connected](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna_cortex/DALL·E%202024-05-02%2012.15.05.jpg)

Neurons use DNA for the construction, methods, signaling, and reporting.

![Super Smart Neurons](https://www.xepl.net/images/neurons/DALL·E%202024-03-14%2013.37.45.jpg)

Every Cortex becomes a unique collection of Neurons, Keywords, Operators, and the like.

![Fully reprogrammable in real-time](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2013.31.24.jpg)

## Multi-core magic

Multi-threaded coding used to be hard.  We did not yet know what we were doing, and there were was only the OS to guide us.

![Like babies in a cage](https://www.xepl.net/images/ancients/DALL·E%202024-03-10%2013.09.17.jpg)

XEPL manages invisible locks to seamlessly hide all multi-threading complexity.

![Multi-Core performance.](https://www.xepl.net/images/ancients/DALL·E%202024-03-30%2018.51.51.jpg)

In the end, your system is optimally powerful, unique and obscure.

![Integrated Neurons configured via XEPL DNA.](https://www.xepl.net/images/neurons/DALL·E%202024-03-24%2014.11.51.jpg)

# A word on security

You hear a lot about computer security.  Hackers and bad actors attack software through vulnerable exploits.  Often posing as a good actor, the bad actor steals secrets and keys to further act like a good actor.

![We think we are protected by our own barriers](https://www.xepl.net/images/surveillance/DALL·E%202024-02-06%2010.20.01.jpg)

Its really complicated stuff.  But it all has one thing in common.  It's their code.

![We are all using ... their code.](https://www.xepl.net/images/surveillance/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2007.46.55.jpg)

Whatever library you use ... many people know the key parts of your codebase ... better than you do.

![Vulnerable at every interface.](https://www.xepl.net/images/surveillance/DALL·E%202024-02-06%2010.16.27.jpg)

And when you open doors that go off processor.

Somebody's watching you.

![Yes, they're out there](https://www.xepl.net/images/surveillance/DALL·E%202024-03-23%2019.58.34.jpg)



# XEPL is Brain ware

Todays processors are much bigger and more powerful than ever.

![Digital Circuits meet DNA Logic.](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex_machines/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2010.19.54.jpg)

Any compute model can be instantly assembled by XEPL.

![Digital Circuits meet DNA Logic.](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna_cortex/DALL·E%202024-02-22%2007.17.22.jpg)

A Cortex capable of tremendous calculations.

![Tremendous processing power](https://www.xepl.net/images/cortex/DALL·E%202024-04-24%2009.11.46.jpg)

## Fresh thinking

Programming with Neurons by using dynamic DNA is fresh thinking.

![In a truly new way to think about software.](https://www.xepl.net/images/ai_thoughts/DALL·E%202024-03-07%2004.15.39.jpg)

## Long time coming

I've been working on this for a long time.

![Trying thing after thing.](https://www.xepl.net/images/skeletons/DALL·E%202024-03-01%2016.59.50.jpg)

At first it was batons, then it was an engine for batons, then came binary connected data, and then, and then, and then, ... a Cortex of Neurons and DNA.

![Until it came to me](https://www.xepl.net/images/ancients/DALL·E%202024-03-30%2018.06.21.jpg)

The computer is a Neuron, is a Cortex, is a DNA Gene database, is a ... C++ system.

![Digital Brain](https://www.xepl.net/images/dna_cortex/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2012.35.58.jpg)


# The next generation
