## Inference Engine

The XEPL OE is a powerful inference engine, programming language and database.

![Amazingly simple](https://www.xepl.net/images/idea/DALL·E%202024-03-30%2017.43.03.jpg)

## Distributed Computing

The XEPL OE is middleware that provides you with a distributed compute environment inside a single process, where threads are agents, and memory is shared.

## Unlimited Capabilities

XEPL Systems are easier to build, easier to change, operate in an instant, and make small computers seem big, and big computers ... a endless breeze.

# XEPL OE + SOLO Browser

XEPL OE is the "core" Operating Environment.

XEPL Solo is a cheap and easy Html/Javascript User Interface.

XEPL SOLO provides a Web Server, and GUI for your Cortex.

## Packed with Power

XEPL Brain.kits allow you to customize your XEPL Cortex.  

Sockets, HTTP, HTML, Timers, CLI, exSamples.

![Everything you need](https://www.xepl.net/images/solo/DALL·E%202024-02-16%2012.48.58.jpg)

Together, Solo demonstrates XEPL ... while ... XEPL Powers Solo.

## Demonstration Framework

This is just a demonstration.  There is not a lot of code here; there is nothing "science like" difficult and all you need is a freely available C++ Compiler and a basic web Browser to get started.

## Moving Forward

Todays tools and techniques are looking old.

Let's build new ones.

## Getting Started

You've made a good choice to get started with XEPL.

All you need is a Computer with a C++17 compiler and a browser, and XEPL Solo ... and this adventure ... is yours.

From the smallest single cores to the largest multi-cores ...  XEPL Solo is is the same.

XEPL runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows; and using my stock Raspberry Pi, I can download and Build XEPL Solo, and be inside the browser in under a minute.

One line to compile (unix example)

> UNIX: `g++ -std=c++17 solo.cpp`

and one line to execute

> `./a.out`

Solo will open up your browser, and point it back the the Solo web server on localhost:8100.
